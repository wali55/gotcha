## Project Description:

Welcome to our landing page builder project! We are inviting developers to collaborate with us on this exciting project to help people save time and money while creating their internet presence. Our landing page builder project aims to solve the problem of users who lose a lot of time creating their landing page or paying a lot of money for someone else to do it.

Our main feature is a structured page with a good usability design, which makes it easy for users to create landing pages according to their needs. The landing page builder has functionalities such as easy click-to-action appropriate for the user's needs, making it more convenient for users to create landing pages. The target audience for our landing page builder project is private individuals, freelancers, and entrepreneurs.

With our landing page builder, users can create landing pages without any programming knowledge, as it has been created with the popular library React.js. The programming languages used in our project are JavaScript, and the frameworks used are Create React App, Next.js, and Express.js. The database used in our project is MongoDB.

We invite developers to collaborate with us by forking the repository and submitting pull requests. We plan to create a development environment that makes it easier for developers to contribute to the project. Our plans include creating milestones such as creating a front end, creating a back end, connecting to the database, and improving logic.

We will be providing documentation on the Wiki Github and facilitating discussions on the Discussion Github section for questions and answers. If you need any support or have any questions regarding the project, you can reach out to us through the contact data on our GitHub account.

We look forward to collaborating with you on this project and making it a success!
